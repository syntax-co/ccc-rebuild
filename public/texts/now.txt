The year is 2569. You have finally awoken from your centuries-long cryogenic 
coma that allowed you to live through armageddon safe and cozy while the rest 
of the world tore itself apart, and it sure did some damage.

The world is in ruins, basically inhabitable. Food is scarce and water is even 
scarcer, and worst of all, no one knows exactly what happened while you were asleep.

Your killer instincts kept you alive before, and again they are all you have 
to rely on as you scavenge the wreckage for resources and fight off others 
doing the same. It's a constant battle for survival against the rest of the 1%, 
where only the most vicious and devious will prosper, and that's exactly how you 
like it. It's Cutthroat Country Club.
